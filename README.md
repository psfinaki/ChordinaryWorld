# Chordinary World
A service that provides the number of harmonies in a song: http://chordinary.world

### How does it work?
Chordinary World currently looks for the best chords for a song at Ultimate Guitar, extracts the chords themselves and does some theoretical analysis on that to bring the number of harmonies.

### What is the future?
Apart from fixing current issues, it would be nice to have the harmonies based on some hardcore math analysis rather than on people's input. Also some stats could be introduced in the future.

### More info?
Some more info is at the about page of the site. My contacts are also there.
