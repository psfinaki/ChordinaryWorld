    <h3>Who are you?</h3>
    <p class="shifted">
        Ahoj! My name is Peter, I am a developer from Czechia. 
        Music is my main hobby so I always wanted to intersect my interests.
    </p>
    <h3>What does this service do?</h3>
    <p class="shifted">
        Chordinary World brings you the number of harmonies in a song.
    </p>
    <h3>What do you mean by harmony here?</h3>
    <p class="shifted">
        Kinda philosophical question but I would say it is a composition of sounds 
        that embraces some stable part of the melody.
    </p>
    <h3>And how is it different from a chord?</h3>
    <p class="shifted">
        A song can have multiple chords dancing around one harmony.
        <button id="toggle1" class="btn-link">Some famous example.</button>
        <div id="example1" hidden>
            <div class="shifted">
                Here are the chords for the verse of <i>Can't Take My Eyes Off You</i>:
            </div>
            <pre>
                     C     
You're just too good to be true
              Cmaj7 
Can't take my eyes off you
               C7
You feel like Heaven to touch
        F
I wanna hold you so much
             Fm
At long last love has arrived
             C
And I thank God I'm alive
                 Dm         Dm7
You're just too good to be true
               C
Can't take my eyes off you
            </pre>
            <div class="shifted">
                Now, <u>C</u>, <u>Cmaj7</u> & <u>C7</u> are different chords, 
                however the latter two are just flavours upon <u>C</u>.
                <br />
                Likewise, <u>Dm7</u> is a flavour upon <u>Dm</u>.
                <br />
                So, we have 7 different chords but only 4 harmonies.
            </div>
        </div>
    </p>
    <h3>What does this mean?</h3>
    <p class="shifted">
        Not much. Having even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOlDewpCfZQ">the most basic</a> 
        chord progression, a song can be rich in arrangement, or melody, or rhythm, or lyrics. 
        <br />
        Having even one harmony, a song can be great!  
        <button id="toggle2" class="btn-link">Seriously?</button>
        <div id="example2" class="shifted" hidden>
            Seriously. 
            <br />
            Listen carefully to <i>The Beatles - Tomorrow Never Knows</i>.
            <br />
            Another example is <i>George Thorogood - Bad To The Bone</i>.
            <br />
            Or, <i>The Guess Who - American Woman</i>.
        </div>
    </p>
    <h3>What is the point then?</h3>
    <p class="shifted">
        Well, if you think to learn a song, the service can tell you how difficult it will be.
        Less harmonies means easier to learn, 
        as you can simplify chords to harmonies and still sound good.
        <br />
        Also, all the logic is server-side thus you can use its API if you suddenly need it.
    </p>
    <h3>How does it work?</h3>
    <p class="shifted">
        Very generally, Chordinary World currently looks for chords at
        <a href="https://www.ultimate-guitar.com">Ultimate Guitar</a>,
        extracts the chords themselves and does some theoretical analysis on that.

        the project is open-source. It is mostly F# as I want to practice some dev stuff.
